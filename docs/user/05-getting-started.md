# Section 2. Getting Started

## System Requirements

The QAT is primarily expected to be accessed via laptops and desktops with standard operating systems such as MS Windows, Linux/Ubuntu, and iOS. The recommended web browser is Google Chrome, but Chromium, Edge, Mozilla Firefox or Safari may be utilized.

It is also suggested that each user of QAT have enough space on their C:drive to allow for storing browser cache data successfully. The amount of space needed depends on the size of the QAT program that is being downloaded and how many apps are currently running and utilizing browser data. Temporary storage is shared among all web apps running in the browser. This shared pool can be up to 1/3 of the of available disk space. Each app can then have up to 20% of the shared pool. For example, if the total available C:drive space is 60 GB, the shared pool is 20 GB; thus, QAT can potentially utilize up to 4 GB. This is calculated from 20% (up to 4 GB) of 1/3 (up to 20 GB) of the available C:drive space (60 GB).

## Levels of Hierarchy in QAT

The QAT system has three levels of hierarchy for conducting operations. The hierarchy levels are as follows:

Application Masters → Realm-level Masters → Program-level Masters

- **Application** Masters is the top-most data hierarchy level in QAT. Application master data applies to all the Realms and Programs within QAT. Most of it is only accessible to Application Admins, though a few of the Application functions are available to Realm Admins such as adding and updating users and assigning roles to users. Application Admins can select the specific application-wide master data they want to add or update.
- **Realm** Level Masters covers all the master data for that Realm which apply to its forecasting and supply planning programs. The Realm Admin will be able to view, create and edit this master data. Programs, Technical Areas, Planning Units, Procurement Agents, and Tree Templates are a few examples of realm master data that the Realm Admin can add and maintain. A lot of the realm level masters are accessible for viewing to Program Admins; however, they do not have the ability to add/update this data.
- **Program** Level Masters is the third level of hierarchy in QAT. While program admins cannot add programs, they can update the program information (e.g., lead times, freight costs, etc.) within their assigned program(s). Program Admin and Program Users can also add and update the program’s data, such as consumption adjustments, extrapolation, and managing trees (in forecasting); and consumption, inventory, shipments (in supply planning).

For more on functionality for Application- and Realm-level administrators, please see [Annex 1: Application & Realm Administrator Manual](13-annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual.md#annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual).

**Programs** are a combination of Country, Technical Area (1 or more), Organization and Region. For example, **FASPonia**–ARV-MOH-National, is a supply planning program under the Global Health Realm for the management and planning of **antiretrovirals** for the ministry of health of the fictional country FASPonia, and the consumption and inventory data is captured at a national level (region).

## User Roles and Permissions

Access to QAT is governed by roles and permissions defined at the Application or Realm level. A user can be assigned multiple roles, which may vary by program.

- **Program Level:** Most users (managers and officers) interact at this level as **Program Admins** or **Program Users**.
- **Realm Level:** **Realm Admins** manage master data and have access to all programs within their realm.
- **Application Level:** **Application Admins** have exclusive access to global structures, roles, and system settings.

For a full list of roles and business functions, refer to [Annex 4: Business Functions](16-annex-4-business-functions.md#annex-4-business-functions).

## Troubleshooting and Software Updates

### Regular Software Releases
QAT receives regular version updates for bug fixes, performance optimization, and new features. When a new version is available, you will be prompted on the login screen to refresh the application.

![New QAT Version Prompt](/img/media/image22.png)
*Figure 4: Software Update Notification*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid data loss during major structural updates, ensure all local programs are uploaded to the server prior to the release. The QAT Support Team will notify you in advance if an upload is required.

### Solving Common Issues
If you encounter technical difficulties, follow these troubleshooting steps in order:

#### 1. Application Refresh
Address most minor glitches by performing a hard refresh. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** simultaneously. This reloads the software and clears temporary glitches, unlike a standard browser refresh (**Ctrl + R**).

#### 2. Full Master Data Sync
If a refresh doesn't work, try a **Full Master Data Sync**. While a regular MDS only fetches incremental changes, a Full MDS reloads all master data from scratch. 
- *Location:* Click the link at the bottom of the application.
- *Requirement:* A stable internet connection is required.

![Full Master Data Sync](/img/media/image24.png)
*Figure 5: Full Master Data Sync Link*

#### 3. Clear Site Data
As a final troubleshooting step, you can clear all locally stored data. 

> [!WARNING]
> This will erase all local changes and downloaded programs. Ensure you have **uploaded all data** to the server before proceeding.

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + I** to open the browser's Developer Tools.
2. Navigate to the **Application** tab.
3. Select **Storage** on the left and click **Clear site data**.
4. Log back in and re-download your programs.

![Clear Site Data](/img/media/image26.png)
*Figure 6: Clearing Site Data*

### Troubleshooting Network Errors
If you see a "Network error" message, it is usually due to:
- **Unstable Internet:** Try a faster connection or wait for better signal.
- **Firewall Restrictions:** Your organization's IT policy may block QAT. Request that your IT department whitelist the following URLs:
    - `api.quantificationanalytics.org`
    - `www.quantificationanalytics.org`

## QAT Helpdesk and Tickets

### Tickets for Adding/Updating Users and Master Data

When a user needs to either add or update a user or master data for any reason, they may do so by taking out a helpdesk ticket. Before requesting any additions or changes to the master data in QAT, the user should first check the realm-level master data (Realm Level Masters \>\> Product) and the Program Catalog Report to make sure the information does not already exist. For more information on how to access and use master data, please see [Program Management](06-managing-programs-and-versions.md#working-with-program-data) and [Realm Masters](13-annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual.md#realm-masters). For information on how to access the Program Catalog, please see [Program Catalog](13-annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual.md#product). To access the QAT Helpdesk:

1.  > Users can access the QAT Helpdesk from two different locations in QAT:
    1.  > On the login page, and

    2.  > from the top right ribbon in QAT

Figure 21: Add Master Data Screen Figure 22: Add Procurement Agent Master Data Screen

After submitting a ticket, the user will be assigned a Ticket Code number (ex: QAT-570). The user will also receive an email notification and the number of “Open Tickets” on the top ribbon in red will increase. This ticket number corresponds to the ticket number stored in the JIRA software management tool. For more information on managing tickets and the JIRA software management tool, please see [Managing Tickets](#managing-tickets).

### Requesting a Change

When a user has an idea for a new feature, functionality, or design element that would make QAT a better application for all users, such as a new report, removing an unnecessary column, etc., they may request a change through the QAT Helpdesk. All change request tickets will require a detailed description and screenshots. Once the technical team receives a user’s change request ticket, it will be reviewed for feasibility and usefulness to all QAT users. If the change request is accepted, it will not be made available in QAT immediately, but will placed in a queue based on realm business priority, criticality, and LOE requirements. To request a change in QAT:

1.  > Click on the QAT Helpdesk icon.

![A red line with numbers and circles Description automatically generated](/img/media/image28.png)

Figure 23: QAT Helpdesk Icon

2.  > Click on “Request a Change” from the QAT Helpdesk menu options.

3.  > Complete the form by filling out the required information and click “Submit,”

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](/img/media/image33.png)

Figure 24: Change Request Ticket

4.  > After submitting a ticket, the user will be assigned a Ticket Code number (ex: QAT-570). The user will also receive an email notification and the number of “Open Tickets” on the top ribbon in red will increase. This ticket number corresponds to the ticket number stored in the JIRA software management tool. For more information on managing tickets and the JIRA software management tool, please see [Managing Tickets](#managing-tickets).

### Reporting a Bug

When a user comes across a potential system issue with QAT, they should attempt to troubleshoot it through an [application refresh](#1-application-refresh) and/or [clearing site data](#3-clear-site-data). If neither of these steps resolve the issue, the user should submit a helpdesk ticket to report the bug.

The bug ticket will be addressed by the development team per the business priority, criticality and available ‘capacity’ via the incremental releases. The steps to raise a ticket in QAT is shown below:

1.  Open the QAT Helpdesk screen and click on “Report a bug”.

2.  Enter a summary of the bug as well as a description of the bug. Please be descriptive and provide as much detail as possible (_e.g., what program/version/functionality you were working on, steps you took to obtain the bug, etc_).

3.  Upload a screenshot of the bug by clicking the “Browse” button and pulling a saved screenshot file from your computer.
    1.  It is also helpful to provide the program export, if possible (see [Program Exports](06-managing-programs-and-versions.md#export) on how to export a local program)

    2.  **\*Note**: If you want to upload multiple files, place the multiple screenshots in a folder on your computer and zip it before browsing in QAT. Then, upload the zipped folder.\*

4.  Choose a priority (Highest, High, Medium, or Low) for the bug based on the urgency and how it affects daily work in QAT
    1.  Response and resolution times for bugs will be based on priority level

5.  Click on the “Submit” button to raise the ticket.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](/img/media/image34.png)

Figure 25: Report a Bug

### Managing Tickets

For enhanced visibility, QAT will give users the option to manage and check the status of their tickets, whether they are adding/editing a user or master data, requesting a change, or reporting a bug. When a user submits a ticket, they will be assigned a Ticket Code number (ex: QAT-570). The user will also receive an email notification and the number of “Open Tickets” on the top ribbon in red will increase. This ticket number corresponds to the ticket number stored in the JIRA software management tool.

![P815#yIS1](/img/media/image35.png) ![A red line with numbers and circles Description automatically generated](/img/media/image28.png)

Figure 26: Helpdesk Ticket Code Number Figure 27: Number of Tickets on Top Ribbon

From the email notification, users may click on “View Requests” to see the status of their ticket. Users may also add additional comments and screenshots to their request, if desired. **Users will always receive an email notification once the ticket has been completed.**

**Note**: In order to fully access the ticket via the JIRA software management tool, users must create an account with a username and password in JIRA. Creating an account in JIRA is **optional**. JIRA is an outside software management tool that can be accessed through the link provided in the email, **by clicking on the HelpDesk icon and then choosing “Manage my tickets” in the top right corner of the pop-up**, or directly through [https://qathelpdesk.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals](https://qathelpdesk.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals).

## Changing Language

To ensure that QAT is adaptable to users around the world, the application displays text in four different languages: English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Users are encouraged to submit tickets if they would like to see a particular label translation improved. (_Note: Translations for application labels can be edited only by **application admins**. Instructions on how to do so can be found in the [translation section](13-annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual.md#database-translation)._)

There are two ways to change the language displayed for the user:

1.  **Login Screen:**

On the top right corner of the login screen, there is a drop-down menu from which users can select their preferred language ahead of logging in. This will not only change the text once you are logged in to QAT but it will also change the text displayed on the login screen.

![P1001#yIS1](/img/media/image75.png)

Figure 34: Login Screen Language Change

2.  **Within QAT:**

Once logged into QAT, the user may change the display language by clicking on the user profile icon on the top right corner of the screen, selecting the preferred language and then the tool will automatically update it’s text/labels.
