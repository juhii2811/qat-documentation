# Section 2. Getting Started

## A. System Requirements

The QAT is primarily expected to be accessed via laptops and desktops with standard operating systems such as MS Windows, Linux/Ubuntu, and iOS. The recommended web browser is Google Chrome, but Chromium, Edge, Mozilla Firefox or Safari may be utilized.

It is also suggested that each user of QAT have enough space on their C:drive to allow for storing browser cache data successfully. The amount of space needed depends on the size of the QAT program that is being downloaded and how many apps are currently running and utilizing browser data. Temporary storage is shared among all web apps running in the browser. This shared pool can be up to 1/3 of the of available disk space. Each app can then have up to 20% of the shared pool. For example, if the total available C:drive space is 60 GB, the shared pool is 20 GB; thus, QAT can potentially utilize up to 4 GB. This is calculated from 20% (up to 4 GB) of 1/3 (up to 20 GB) of the available C:drive space (60 GB).

## B. Levels of Hierarchy in QAT

The QAT system has **three levels of hierarchy** for conducting operations. The hierarchy levels are as follows:

<p align="center">
  <em>Application Masters → Realm-level Masters → Program-level Masters</em>
</p>

- **Application** Masters is the top-most data hierarchy level in QAT. Application master data applies to all the Realms and Programs within QAT. Most of it is only accessible to Application Admins, though a few of the Application functions are available to Realm Admins such as adding and updating users and assigning roles to users. Application Admins can select the specific application-wide master data they want to add or update.
- **Realm** Level Masters covers all the master data for that Realm which apply to its forecasting and supply planning programs. The Realm Admin will be able to view, create and edit this master data. Programs, Technical Areas, Planning Units, Procurement Agents, and Tree Templates are a few examples of realm master data that the Realm Admin can add and maintain. A lot of the realm level masters are accessible for viewing to Program Admins; however, they do not have the ability to add/update this data.
- **Program** Level Masters is the third level of hierarchy in QAT. While program admins cannot add programs, they can update the program information (e.g., lead times, freight costs, etc.) within their assigned program(s). Program Admin and Program Users can also add and update the program’s data, such as consumption adjustments, extrapolation, and managing trees (in forecasting); and consumption, inventory, shipments (in supply planning).

For more on functionality for Application- and Realm-level administrators, please see [Annex 1: Application & Realm Administrator Manual.](13-annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual.md#annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual)

**Programs** are a combination of Country, Technical Area (1 or more), Organization and Region. For example, **FASPonia**–ARV-MOH-National, is a supply planning program under the Global Health Realm for the management and planning of **antiretrovirals** for the ministry of health of the fictional country FASPonia, and the consumption and inventory data is captured at a national level (region).

## C. User Roles and Permissions

Users can be assigned one of many roles available in QAT that define what level of data users have access to and how they interact with that data, according to the following hierarchy:

<p align="center">
  <em>Application-level data → Realm-level data → Program-level data</em>
</p>

Users will have access to one or more levels of data as per the roles and permissions assigned to them. Roles are defined centrally at the Application or Realm Level. A role can have multiple permissions assigned to it. These permissions define what actions a user is entitled to. A user can be assigned multiple roles and can vary the role based on program access. For example, a user could be a supply plan program admin for program A and a supply plan reports viewer for program B. (NOTE: Roles can be assigned to only those users that are registered in QAT).

The vast majority of QAT users – in-country health program managers and officers - will interact with the application at the **program level**; thus, this manual will focus mainly on tasks and functions that apply to this group. The Program Admin and Program User roles are usually configured to have access to one or multiple program(s) within a geographic jurisdiction i.e., a Program Admin can only manage assigned program(s) in their country, but not a realm.

A **Realm** Admin manages master data and can have access to all programs within that realm.
At the **Application** level, there is an Application Administrator role. This role has exclusive access to create application-wide data structures, including adding languages, roles, creating realms, updating static and dynamic labels, among other business functions.

Please refer to [Annex 4: Business Functions](16-annex-4-business-functions.md#annex-4-business-functions) for a table with the full list of QAT business functions available per user role.

## D. How to Log into QAT and Install the Progressive Web Application (PWA)

**How to log in to QAT for the first time (online)**
1. If you do not have a user profile, please contact the realm administrator to create a new user account and corresponding role on your behalf.

## F. Working Offline

QAT is a hybrid tool and can be operated in both the online and offline mode. There are two ways to force the offline mode of QAT: on the login page before logging into QAT or under the profile settings after logging into QAT. It may be useful to switch to the offline mode of QAT when internet bandwidth is low.

| ![Offline Button on Profile Page](/img/media/image18.png) | ![Offline Button on Login Page](/img/media/image19.png) |
| :---: | :---: |
| *Figure 9: Offline Button on Profile Page* | *Figure 10: Offline Button on Login Page* |

The Profile icon on the top right corner shows a green-colored circle when working in online mode. When the user switches to offline mode the color changes to red, as shown on the screenshot below.

![Offline vs. Online Icons](/img/media/image20.png)
*Figure 11: Offline vs. Online Icons*

The below table details some of the key functionalities that can be done in QAT offline as well as some of the functionalities that must be done online:

| What can a user do Offline?* | What must a user do Online? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Import/Export supply plans/forecasts | Reset password |
| View master data | Sync master data |
| Build Trees/Scenarios | Update program info, planning units, version settings, or budgets |
| Enter/update supply plan transactional data, and manually enter/adjust consumption data | Import forecast data to/from the Supply Planning Module to/from the Forecasting Module |
| Extrapolate using moving averages or semi-averages | Extrapolate using linear regression, triple-exponential smoothing (TES), or ARIMA methods |
| Supply/Scenario plan | Create tickets |
| View QAT Problem List | Download/Upload supply plans/forecasts |
| View program reports & forecast outputs | View global reports |

*\*Note: Even when online, functions in the "offline" column require that that a program is downloaded- see Section 3 for more information*

*Table 2: Online vs. Offline Capabilities*

## G. QAT Release Updates

To maintain the QAT application, regular version releases are pushed automatically to the QAT application and all realm users. These version releases could occur due to the following:
- Regularly scheduled maintenance for bug fixes and application optimization
- Unplanned emergency maintenance for high priority/urgent bug fixes
- Periodic updates related to enhancements or new features

![QAT Version Releases](/img/media/image21.png)
*Figure 12: QAT Version Releases*

Most version releases will not require significant action from the user, except to refresh the QAT application prior to logging-in. QAT will prompt user that there is a new version of QAT on the login page:

![New QAT Version Released Prompt for Users](/img/media/image22.png)
*Figure 13: New QAT Version Released Prompt for Users*

If there is a major change to the structure of the QAT backend architecture, users may be required to upload their latest version to the server (see the [Upload](06-managing-programs-and-versions.md#upload) section for more information) to avoid losing data once the new version of QAT is released. The QAT Support Team (support@quantificationanalytics.org) will inform users well in advance if a program upload is required.

## H. Troubleshooting

When a user comes across a potential system issue with QAT, they should attempt to troubleshoot the issue by trying the solutions outlined in this section, in the order they are described (i.e. try H1 first, and if that does not work, then attempt H2, and then H3). If none of these steps resolve the issue, the user should submit a helpdesk ticket to report the bug (see section on ‘[Reporting a Bug](#reporting-a-bug)’).

### H1. When and How to Conduct an Application Refresh

The QAT development team deploys incremental software releases to address the bugs and changes needed for the application. QAT prompt users to do so on the log-in screen after each release (see Figure 12). To conduct an application refresh, users should press "Ctrl" + "Shift" + "R" at the same time on their keyboard.

![Hold Ctrl + Shift + R (all 3 keys) to conduct an Application Refresh](/img/media/image23.png)
*Figure 14: Hold Ctrl + Shift + R (all 3 keys) to conduct an Application Refresh*

The application refresh can also be used to help troubleshoot any issues experienced while using QAT. After holding all 3 keys, the software should reload automatically. Note that the application refresh is different than simply refreshing the browser ("Ctrl" + "R").

### H2. When and How to Conduct a Full Master Data Sync (MDS)

If an application refresh ("Ctrl" + "Shift" + "R") does not solve your software issue, you can try conducting a "Full Master Data Sync." To do so, please ensure you have a stable internet connection, and then click on the "Full Master Data Sync" link at the bottom of the application (see Figure 13). This solution is likely to work if you are experiencing master data issues that may be the result of unstable internet that disturbed the regular Master Data Sync (MDS) described in Section 2.J Navigation and Menu Bar.
- In a regular MDS, only incremental changes are synced between the server and your local computer based on the last time a MDS was completed.
- In a full MDS, the entire master data is loaded irrespective of the last time QAT was synced, as if this is the first time you are loading master data. Therefore, this will take longer than a normal MDS.

![Click "Full Master Data Sync"](/img/media/image24.png)
*Figure 15: Click "Full Master Data Sync"*

### H3. When and How to Clear Site Data

If refreshing QAT (Ctrl + Shift + R) and a Full Master Data Sync do not resolve the issue, the user should attempt to clear site data in order to troubleshoot the issue. Follow the below steps in order to clear site data on your QAT:

***Warning:*** *Clearing site data on QAT clears all local data on the PWA and Web Browser, including any changes that you have made since you last uploaded. Ensure you have uploaded any unsaved programs <u>before</u> clearing site data.*

1. Click on "Ctrl"+"Shift"+"I" keys at the same time on your keyboard.

![Ctrl + Shift + I](/img/media/image25.png)
*Figure 16: Ctrl + Shift + I*

2. Go to "Application".
3. On the left-hand side of the screen, click where it says "Storage".
4. Once on the "Storage" screen, select "Clear site data." This will clear any data that was not uploaded.
5. Log in again to QAT and re-download any programs you need. (Clearing site data erases all programs from your local machine so you will need to re-download those programs.)

![Clear Site Data](/img/media/image26.png)
*Figure 17: Clear Site Data*

### H4. Troubleshooting Network Errors
Users may see the following error message when logging in or while using QAT:

> "Network error. Please check your internet connection or contact your organizational IT department to ensure [api.quantificationanalytics.org/#](https://api.quantificationanalytics.org/#) and [www.quantificationanalytics.org/#](https://www.quantificationanalytics.org/#) are whitelisted for firewall access."

This message appears for two reasons: 1) Unstable internet, or 2) Restricted internet.

**Unstable Internet:** Use another internet with a stable or faster connection, or try again later.

**Restricted Internet:** QAT can be accessed by most private internet connections, but sometimes organizational IT systems have stricter security control, and thus they are flagging QAT as a potential threat. In this case, users have two options:
1. Use another internet connection without restrictions, or
2. Enable firewall access by whitelisting the below two site URLs. User may need to contact their organizational IT staff for assistance
   - [api.quantificationanalytics.org/#](https://api.quantificationanalytics.org/#)
   - [www.quantificationanalytics.org/#](https://www.quantificationanalytics.org/#)

## I. QAT Helpdesk and Tickets

### I1. Tickets for Adding/Updating Users and Master Data
When a user needs to either add or update a user or master data for any reason, they may do so by taking out a helpdesk ticket. Before requesting any additions or changes to the master data in QAT, the user should first check the realm-level master data (Realm Level Masters >> Product) and the Program Catalog Report to make sure the information does not already exist. For more information on how to access and use master data, please see [Program Management](06-managing-programs-and-versions.md#working-with-program-data) and [Realm Masters](13-annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual.md#realm-masters). For information on how to access the Program Catalog, please see [Program Catalog](13-annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual.md#product). To access the QAT Helpdesk:

1. Users can access the QAT Helpdesk from two different locations in QAT:
   a. On the login page, and
   b. from the top right ribbon in QAT

![QAT Login Screen Helpdesk](/img/media/image27.png)

![QAT Top Ribbon Helpdesk](/img/media/image28.png)
*Figure 18: Three location to access the QAT Helpdesk*

2. Four options will appear for taking out a ticket: Add/Update User, Add/Update Master Data, Change Request, and Report a Bug. See below sections on [Change Requests](#requesting-a-change) and [Report a Bug](#reporting-a-bug).

![QAT Helpdesk Menu](/img/media/image29.png)
*Figure 19: QAT Helpdesk Menu*

3. Choose to Add/Update User or Add/Update Master data. Either option will take you to different screens for more information.
4. Enter the information required in the form and click "Submit."

![Add/Update User Screen](/img/media/image30.png)
*Figure 20: Add/Update User Screen*

| ![Add Master Data Screen](/img/media/image31.png) | ![Add Procurement Agent Master Data Screen](/img/media/image32.png) |
| :---: | :---: |
| *Figure 21: Add Master Data Screen* | *Figure 22: Add Procurement Agent Master Data Screen* |

After submitting a ticket, the user will be assigned a Ticket Code number (ex: QAT-570). The user will also receive an email notification and the number of "Open Tickets" on the top ribbon in red will increase. This ticket number corresponds to the ticket number stored in the JIRA software management tool. For more information on managing tickets and the JIRA software management tool, please see [Managing Tickets](#managing-tickets).

### I2. Requesting a Change
When a user has an idea for a new feature, functionality, or design element that would make QAT a better application for all users, such as a new report, removing an unnecessary column, etc., they may request a change through the QAT Helpdesk. All change request tickets will require a detailed description and screenshots. Once the technical team receives a user's change request ticket, it will be reviewed for feasibility and usefulness to all QAT users. If the change request is accepted, it will not be made available in QAT immediately, but will placed in a queue based on realm business priority, criticality, and LOE requirements. To request a change in QAT:

1. Click on the QAT Helpdesk icon.

![QAT Helpdesk Icon](/img/media/image28.png)
*Figure 23: QAT Helpdesk Icon*

2. Click on "Request a Change" from the QAT Helpdesk menu options.
3. Complete the form by filling out the required information and click "Submit,"

![Change Request Ticket](/img/media/image33.png)
*Figure 24: Change Request Ticket*

4. After submitting a ticket, the user will be assigned a Ticket Code number (ex: QAT-570). The user will also receive an email notification and the number of "Open Tickets" on the top ribbon in red will increase. This ticket number corresponds to the ticket number stored in the JIRA software management tool. For more information on managing tickets and the JIRA software management tool, please see [Managing Tickets](#managing-tickets).

### I3. Reporting a Bug
When a user comes across a potential system issue with QAT, they should attempt to troubleshoot it through an [application refresh](#h1-when-and-how-to-conduct-an-application-refresh) and/or [clearing site data](#h3-when-and-how-to-clear-site-data). If neither of these steps resolve the issue, the user should submit a helpdesk ticket to report the bug.

The bug ticket will be addressed by the development team per the business priority, criticality and available 'capacity' via the incremental releases. The steps to raise a ticket in QAT is shown below:
1. Open the QAT Helpdesk screen and click on "Report a bug".
2. Enter a summary of the bug as well as a description of the bug. Please be descriptive and provide as much detail as possible (e.g., what program/version/functionality you were working on, steps you took to obtain the bug, etc).
3. Upload a screenshot of the bug by clicking the "Browse" button and pulling a saved screenshot file from your computer.
   a. It is also helpful to provide the program export, if possible (see [Program Exports](06-managing-programs-and-versions.md#export) on how to export a local program)
   b. **Note:** If you want to upload multiple files, place the multiple screenshots in a folder on your computer and zip it before browsing in QAT. Then, upload the zipped folder.
4. Choose a priority (Highest, High, Medium, or Low) for the bug based on the urgency and how it affects daily work in QAT
   a. Response and resolution times for bugs will be based on priority level
5. Click on the "Submit" button to raise the ticket.

![Report a Bug](/img/media/image34.png)
*Figure 25: Report a Bug*

### I4. Managing Tickets
For enhanced visibility, QAT will give users the option to manage and check the status of their tickets, whether they are adding/editing a user or master data, requesting a change, or reporting a bug. When a user submits a ticket, they will be assigned a Ticket Code number (ex: QAT-570). The user will also receive an email notification and the number of "Open Tickets" on the top ribbon in red will increase. This ticket number corresponds to the ticket number stored in the JIRA software management tool.

| ![Helpdesk Ticket Code Number](/img/media/image35.png) | ![Number of Tickets on Top Ribbon](/img/media/image28.png) |
| :---: | :---: |
| *Figure 26: Helpdesk Ticket Code Number* | *Figure 27: Number of Tickets on Top Ribbon* |

From the email notification, users may click on “View Requests” to see the status of their ticket. Users may also add additional comments and screenshots to their request, if desired. **Users will always receive an email notification once the ticket has been completed.**

**Note**: In order to fully access the ticket via the JIRA software management tool, users must create an account with a username and password in JIRA. Creating an account in JIRA is **optional**. JIRA is an outside software management tool that can be accessed through the link provided in the email, **by clicking on the HelpDesk icon and then choosing “Manage my tickets” in the top right corner of the pop-up**, or directly through [https://qathelpdesk.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals](https://qathelpdesk.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals).

## K. Changing Language
To ensure that QAT is adaptable to users around the world, the application displays text in four different languages: English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Users are encouraged to submit tickets if they would like to see a particular label translation improved. (*Note: Translations for application labels can be edited only by **application admins**. Instructions on how to do so can be found in the [translation section](13-annex-1-application-realm-administrator-manual.md#a-database-translation).*)

There are two ways to change the language displayed for the user:
**1. Login Screen:**
On the top right corner of the login screen, there is a drop-down menu from which users can select their
preferred language ahead of logging in. This will not only change the text once you are logged in to QAT but
it will also change the text displayed on the login screen.

![Login Screen Language Change](/img/media/image75.png)
*Figure 34: Login Screen Language Change*

**2. Within QAT:**
Once logged into QAT, the user may change the display language by clicking on the user profile icon on the top right corner of the screen, selecting the preferred language and then the tool will automatically update it's text/labels.

## L. QAT Dashboard
The supply planning dashboard provides a comprehensive interface with enhanced visualizations and analytics. It is structured into three main sections: Ticker, Overview, Program Spotlight.

![Dashboard](/img/media/image77.jpeg)
*Figure 36: Dashboard*

**1. Ticker** – This section displays key information through three automatically scrolling tiles.
To manually navigate the tiles, click the dots at the bottom of the tiles. Each tile links to rel-
evant screens. Click on the tile name to be directed to that screen (if you lack access, an ap-
propriate message will display). For example, clicking on the ‘ERP linking’ tile will take you to
the ERP Linking screen.
   **a. Realm:** Provides global metrics, such as the number of countries, users, supply plan-
   ning programs, and forecasting programs.
   **b. My Access:** Highlights the supply plans you have access to, including downloaded
   supply plans.
   **c. ERP Linking:** Displays number of linked shipments by realm and downloaded pro-
   grams.
